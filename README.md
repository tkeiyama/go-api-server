# What is this?

This is a sample API server written in Go.  
I make this to learn Go.  

## Improvable things

I'm not sure that whether these things will improve the implementation or not.  
But the things are worth trying.  

- **Make file/folder names uppercase**: These are supposed to be used outside of every package. A externing function name in Go should be uppercase, so that may happen even on the file/folder names.
